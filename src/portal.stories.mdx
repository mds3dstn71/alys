# Portal

A Portal is a relatively lower-level component that is responsible for rendering components in
another element, possibly not in the current component heirarchy.

## Usage

One use for a Portal is for making modals. Modals are useful for showing prompts that the user must
immediately resolve in order to move on with some process. The whole screen will be dimmed and some
dialog component will be presented where UI elements will accept input to either confirm and proceed
or cancel.

To create a modal using a Portal, you must add first the modal root element, the UI elements for
showing the modal (e.g. button, etc.), and the modal contents to appear when the modal is opened.

The modal root is a container where the modal contents will be "injected". If the React application
is rendered in a `div#app-root`, the modal root should be placed as a sibling to it. The modal root
ID must be `modal-root` and usually, there should only be one modal root for the whole application.

```html
<body>
  <div id="modal-root"></div>
  <div id="app-root"></div>
</body>
```

The modal can be opened programmatically, after some asynchronous operation has finished, e.g.
fetching some data results in a failure, a timer has finished, etc., but it can also be opened
through UI elements like buttons:

```jsx
<button onClick={toggleModal}>Show modal</button>
```

The modal contents are can be shown conditionally inside stateful components:

```jsx
state.showModal ? (
  <Portal domId="modal-root">
    Hello <button onClick={toggleModal}>Close modal</button>
  </Portal>
) : null;
```

<Props of={Portal} />

### Demo

Click the button below to show a simple modal. Once the modal is shown, there is another button to
close the modal.

<Story
  name="Portal/Example"
  decorators={[
  (StoryFn) => (
    <Fragment>
      <ModalRoot />
      <Centered>
        <StoryFn />
      </Centered>
    </Fragment>
  )]}
>
  <PortalExample />
</Story>
