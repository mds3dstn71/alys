> A tiny React component library.

## Background

This project started as "classless" PostCSS/CSS toolkit as a way to practice
CSS. Although, the original design featured rounded and colorful aesthetic,
which admittedly is not unique nor mind-blowing, it was usable and decent enough
for a more backend-leaning developer like me.

Eventually, it was determined that a "classless" toolkit is not that useful
because more complicated applications would contain a lot of different
components and these components would most likely have specialized styles. If
the web page is simple or, maybe, used as a base style, then this toolkit would
be fine.

The next iteration produced a small Vue component library. Initially, the goal
was to port the styles to components, but this was not fulfilled (because of
reasons and I kinda forgot about this repo).

Finally (hopefully), this newest iteration would lead to the desired `v1.0.0`
release. This time, it's written with JavaScript using the React framework. So,
why the switch? Well, React is very popular. Also, it ~~requires~~ encourages
developers to be good at JavaScript to use it well.

## Quick Start

### npm

```bash
npm install alys
```

### Releases

```
https://github.com/rmjordas/alys/releases
```

### unpkg

```
https://unpkg.com/alys@latest/dist/alys.css
https://unpkg.com/alys@latest/dist/alys.umd.min.js
https://unpkg.com/alys@latest/dist/alys.common.js
```

## Development

To run this app on your machine, clone the repository, then run the
`npm install` command on your terminal to install the project dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rmjordas/alys.git
cd alys
npm install
```

Enter `npm run build` in your terminal to compile the app in a `dist` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Storybook

You can easily develop and interact with your components by using Storybook. To
run the local server, simply run:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) to view your stories.
They should automatically update as you develop.

Storybook will pick up any story from a `*.story.js` file in a component folder.

## Testing

Enter one of the commands below to run the tests. The first command lints the
source files before running a single round of tests. The second similarly lints
and runs a round of tests but does not exit immediately after and any change to
the source files will trigger another round of tests.

```bash
yarn test # or
yarn test:watch
```

To exit the process, press `Ctrl` + `C`.
