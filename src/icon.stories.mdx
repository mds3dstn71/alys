# Icon

Icons can be used for decorating an interface element to mostly to convey visual representation of
the interface element's label.

## Usage

If used as decoration, it must be provided with an `aria-hidden` attribute so that screen readers
will ignore this element:

```jsx
<Button>
  <Icon aria-hidden>
    <path d="..." />
  </Icon>
  My button message
</Button>
```

Otherwise, when the icon is used solely to provide the info (in place of a label), it must be
provided with an alternative text via the `aria-label` attribute:

```jsx
<Button>
  <Icon aria-label="Download this file">
    <path d="..." />
  </Icon>
</Button>
```

## Library Icons

Alys includes icon components based on [Eva Icons](https://github.com/akveo/eva-icons) (MIT
License). There are currently only a few icons available but more icons will be added in the future.

The names of the icons follow that of the upstream icons repository's. If you're bothered by some
icon names, please open an issue in the upstream icons repository.
