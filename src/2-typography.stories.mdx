# Typography

It is important to have a standard for how text should appear in the UI elements to help provide a
better experience for users.

The library's main typeface is called "Inter" which is used on a lot of components that are not
source code.

## Usage

Typography values are available under the `typography` property of the theme.

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from '@emotion/core';
import { useTheme } from 'emotion-theming';

export const Text = ({ children }) => {
  const theme = useTheme().default;

  return (
    <span
      css={{
        fontFamily: theme.typography.fonts.base,
        fontWeight: theme.typography.weight.regular,
        fontSize: theme.typography.size.s3,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </span>
  );
};
```

## Font sizes

Font sizes are divided into three groups, small (`s`), medium (`m`) and large (`l`) with each group
having three sub-values (i.e. `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, where `x` is the group name).

## Font Weights

Heavier font weights can be used to adjust the importance of a portion of text.
